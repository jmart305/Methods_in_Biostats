## Problem 6c  

```{r}
set.seed(6)
# Draw n = 1000 from the uniform distribution
uniform <- runif(1000,0,1)
# Define inverse CDF for Weibull distribution
weibull_inv_cdf <- function(u, beta, gamma) {
  (-beta*log(1-u))^(1/gamma)
}
# plug in uniform distribution sample to inverse CDF
weibull_dist <- weibull_inv_cdf(uniform, 5, 2)
head(weibull_dist)
# show results in a histogram
hist(weibull_dist, main = "Weibull Distribution", xlab = "x")
```
