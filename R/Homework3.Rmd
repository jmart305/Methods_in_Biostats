### Problem 1b  

```{r}
likelihood <- function(p) {
  p^7*(1-p)^3
}
phat <- 0.7
max_likelihood <- likelihood(phat)
# renormalize:
renormalizing_constant <- 1 / likelihood(phat)

x <- seq(0,1,0.01)
y <- renormalizing_constant*likelihood(x)
lplot <- data.frame(cbind(x,y))
ggplot(lplot, aes(x, y)) +
  geom_line() + xlab("Probability") + ylab("Likelihood") + ggtitle("Likelihood Function for Flip Scenario")
```

This likelihood suggests that the coin is not fair, since the likelihood function plot is right skewed, meaning there is a higher likelihood of the probability of flipping heads to be greater than 0.5, meaning that the coin is not fair.
